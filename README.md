# Software Development 1 Website
=================================
## Description
- - -
Team Deckard is creating a website under the instruction of Dr. Anca Doloc-Mihu for our Software Development 1 project. The website will be able to display the projects and teams associated with Soft Dev 1 to display the creative assignments created at Georgia Gwinnett College during this course. Users will easily see projects created by other teams, as well as bios of the teams, feedback from the assignments, and motivation for future students taking Soft Dev 1. We hope that the website created by Team Deckard will help reduce the anxiety and display to others the creative ideas and fun GGC students have while taking this course. This Spring semester will be archived once it is over and we hope the template will be useful to future students.
